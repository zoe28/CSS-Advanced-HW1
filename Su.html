      <h2><em>My education background</em></h2>
      <p id="first-paragraph">
        I just graduated from college last year and my major was <u>English Education</u>.
        At first, I didn't have any idea what a real teacher's life would be like.
        But after two internships in different middle schools, I found that I didn't
        have any <del>passion</del> for teaching.
        <q cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/jon_bon_jovi_204458">
          <ins>Nothing is as important as passion. No matter what you want to do with your
          life, be passionate.</ins>
        </q>
        So I decided to change my major to <b>Computer Science</b> since I have always been
        interested in programming.

      <h3><i>Personal goals</i></h3>
      <blockquote id="quote">
        <ins>A most important, but also most elusive, aspect of any tool is its influence
        on the habits of those who train themselves in its use. If the tool is a
        programming language this influence is, whether we like it or not, an
        influence on our thinking habits.</ins>
      </blockquote>
      <p id="second-paragraph">
        I want to be a frontend programmer in the future, so learning
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a good
        start. I did a little bit of online HTML coding in the past, but my goal is
        to be good at HTML and to be prepared for the next CSS and Javascript classes.
        I'm in the web programming certificate program.
        <br>
        HTML is my 1<sup>st</sup> programming class.
